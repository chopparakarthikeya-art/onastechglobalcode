Consumers and businesses alike are actively choosing low-carbon homes and offices, and they expect greater empowerment and a more sophisticated experience from their energy suppliers.  

Gradual decentralization of the energy market is allowing new entities to play an increasingly critical role by offering new services and creating new markets, diverting customer attention away from utilities. New technologies and aging assets compound matters, even as federal governments pledge billions of dollars to modernize infrastructure and make the grid smarter and more self-reliant. With a plethora of point solutions from energy tech companies, utilities are facing a new challenge: delivering a cohesive business value to its customers. Utilities are struggling to balance their fundamental obligations to provide ‘lights on’ reliability against the increasing demand to transform into a new-age energy service provider.`,
