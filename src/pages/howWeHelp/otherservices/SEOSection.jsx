              A search engine optimization (SEO) technique is used to improve a
              website’s visibility and ranking in search engine results. It
              involves various techniques, such as keyword research, on-page
              optimization, and link building, to make your website more
              appealing to search engines.

              you can attract more potential customers, establish your business
