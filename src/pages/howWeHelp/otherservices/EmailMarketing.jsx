                            Email marketing is a powerful digital marketing strategy that involves sending targeted and personalized emails to a group of subscribers or potential customers.

                            The importance of email marketing lies in its ability to deliver highly relevant content directly to the inbox of interested recipients, creating a direct and personalized communication channel. It enables businesses to promote products, share valuable information, and engage with customers on a one-on-one basis, fostering trust and loyalty. Email marketing also offers a high return on investment (ROI) and is cost-effective compared to traditional marketing channels.
